|"I must not fear.
|Fear is the mind-killer.
|Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
|I will face my fear.
|I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
|And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
|Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
